# Example NuOscillator configuration files

These are examples of the input files needed by NuOscillator that are provided
with gundamOscAnaTools so that the TabulatedNuOscillator code can be tested.  When this is used in a GUNDAM configuration, the files should be copied into the configuration area, and modified as needed.  See gudi-anoa-sens25a for an example.
